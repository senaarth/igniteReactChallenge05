## About this project

The SpaceTraveling plataform is a simple blog with a posts list, each one with a comment section (visit it [here](https://spacetravel.vercel.app/)). The project was a challenge at the Ignite Bootcamp, from the RocketSeat company. The students were suppose to build the application from scratch following a [Figma Layout](https://www.figma.com/file/0Y26j0tf1K2WB5c1ja5hov/Desafios-M%C3%B3dulo-3-ReactJS?node-id=0%3A1) and using the requested technologies: NextJs with TypeScript and Sass, PrismicCMS for the content management and the github widget Utterances from the comments.

## Knowledge Acquired 

* This project helped me to improve my skills with NextJs, TypeScript and Sass and learn more about server side rendering and static sites generation. 
* I was able to integrate the application with a CMS (Prismic) with a preview mode where the manager can see the content before publishing it.
* I learned how to use a new tool, uterrances, to create a comment section for each post.
